The BehaviorSearch software was initially developed as part of Forrest Stonedahl's doctoral thesis research, with adviser Uri Wilensky at the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at Northwestern University.
It is an open source project, and new contributors/developers are welcome (contact feedback@behaviorsearch.org if interested).

General acknowledgments:
 * Thesis committee members: Doug Downey, Luis Amaral, and especially Bill Rand, for their helpful discussion and insights.
 * Everyone in the CCL lab group, and Forrest's wife Susa, for their help and encouragement.
 * John H. Miller, for laying out the original conceptual framework for Active Nonlinear Testing.
 * The National Science Foundation (grant IIS-0713619), and the Walter P. Murphy Society (IABM course development grant), for making this work possible by their generous support.

Additional contributions:
 * Susa Stonedahl designed the BehaviorSpace icon/logo (based on the NetLogo icon, which is adapted from the version designed by Aaron Bramson.)
 * Kevin Zollman submitted a patch to help update BehaviorSearch to work with NetLogo 5.     
 * An Nguyen Dang migrated the GUI from Swing to JavaFX.
 * Robert Grider helped bundle BehaviorSearch with NetLogo 6 and improved native support on Macs.
