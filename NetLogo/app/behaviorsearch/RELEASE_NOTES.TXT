NEW for Version 1.10
 * Migrated/modernized the UI from Swing to JavaFX (Thanks An Nguyen Dang!)

Version 1.02:
 * Various updates and tweaks to interoperate (and be bundled) with NetLogo 6.

Version 1.01:
 * Ability to override parameter spec ranges from the command line...
   (per the request of a BehaviorSearch user)
 * No other changes, and file formats remain identical,
   so should be backward/forward compatible with version 1.00

Version 1.00: 
 * Updated BehaviorSearch to work with NetLogo 5.0.x  
   (Kudos to Kevin Zollman who submitted a patch that assisted with this transition!)
   Note that this and future versions of BehaviorSearch will not support NetLogo 4.x.
 * Fixed issue with range of possible initial seeds for the random number generator.
   (This was fixed in NetLogo here: https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/issues/111 )  
 * Search protocols (.bsearch files) created with earlier versions of BehaviorSearch
   should still load/work in this version, although the change in how random seeds
   are handled means that results from doing the same search with the same random 
   seed may differ slightly from the results from previous versions.
 * Fixed an issue with BehaviorSearch's error reporting (of NetLogo language errors)
   which had been broken (or at least made worse) by a change (regression?) in how
   NetLogo 5's controlling API handles runtime errors. 

Version 0.76:
* Still compatible with NetLogo 4.x (not 5.x).
* Mostly code cleanup & documentation fixes

Version 0.75:
* Added Simulated Annealing search algorithm.
* Added "Derivative" functionality, for searching for the amount of change caused by a small change in a specified parameter.
* Added additional example search files.
* Lowered default maximum Java heap size on Windows, since it was causing problems for some people so they couldn't even launch the application. 
* Various other fixes & enhancements I didn't write down...

Version 0.73:
* Fixed possible problem in behaviorsearch_gui launcher script for Linux, when JAVA_HOME was defined.

Version 0.72:

First public release.
