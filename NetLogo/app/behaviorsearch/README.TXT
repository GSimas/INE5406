INSTALLATION:  (It should now be bundled with NetLogo 6.0+, so no installation needed!)

RUNNING:

If you want to use Behaviorsearch through the GUI, you can simply run the application (it's installed alongside the NetLogo application in NetLogo 6.0 and later).

If you want to run behaviorsearch headlessly, you must set the JAVA_HOME environment variable in your shell. 
Then run the behaviorsearch_headless script in the "behaviorsearch" directory. 
In Windows and Linux, the behaviorsearch directory is located inside the "app" folder within the NetLogo installation.

Windows:  Run "app\behaviorsearch\behaviorsearch_headless.bat" (located in the NetLogo installation folder).
Mac: Run "behaviorsearch/behaviorsearch_gui.command" (located in the NetLogo installation folder).
Linux: Run "app/behaviorsearch/behaviorsearch_gui.sh" (located in the NetLogo installation folder).
