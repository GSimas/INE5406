<p>
  The Interface tab is where you watch your model run. It also has
  tools you can use to inspect and alter what's going on inside the
  model.
<p>
  When you first open NetLogo, the Interface tab is empty except for
  the view, where the turtles and patches appear, and the Command
  Center, which allows you to issue NetLogo commands.

  <a>Working with
  interface elements</a>
</h2>
<p id="interfaceelements">
  The toolbar on the Interface tab contains buttons that let you edit,
  delete, and create items in the Interface tab and a menu that lets
  you select different interface items (such as buttons and sliders).
  <!-- need to scale this one down slightly to fit in PDF without clipping -->
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image007.gif">
<p>
  The buttons in the toolbar are described below.
<p>
  <strong>Adding:</strong> To add an interface element, select the element from
  the drop down menu. Note that the Add button stays down. Then click
  on the white area below the toolbar. (If the menu is already showing
  the right type, you can just press the Add button instead of using
  the menu again.)
<p>
  <strong>Selecting:</strong> To select an interface element, drag a rectangle
  around it with your mouse. A gray border with black handles will
  appear around the element to show it is selected.
<p>
  <strong>Selecting multiple items:</strong> You can select multiple interface
  elements at the same time by including them in the rectangle you
  drag. If multiple elements are selected, one of them is the
  &quot;key&quot; item, which means that if you use the
  &quot;Edit&quot; or &quot;Delete&quot; buttons on the Interface
  Toolbar, only the key item is affected. The key item's border is
  darker gray.
<p>
  <strong>Unselecting:</strong> To unselect all interface elements, click the
  mouse on the white background of the Interface tab. To unselect an
  individual element, right-click the element and choose
  &quot;Unselect&quot; from the popup menu.
<p>
  <strong>Editing:</strong> To change the characteristics of an interface
  element, select the element, then press the &quot;Edit&quot; button
  on the Interface toolbar. You may also double click the element once
  it is selected. A third way to edit an element is to right-click it
  and choose &quot;Edit&quot; from the popup menu. If you use this last
  method, it is not necessary to select the element first.
<p>
  <strong>Moving:</strong> Select the interface element, then drag it with your
  mouse to its new location. If you hold down the shift key while
  dragging, the element will move only straight up and down or straight
  left and right.
<p>
  <strong>Resizing:</strong> Select the interface element, then drag the black
  &quot;handles&quot; in the selection border.
<p>
  <strong>Deleting:</strong> Select the element or elements you want to delete,
  then press the &quot;Delete&quot; button on the Interface toolbar.
  You may also delete an element by right-clicking it and choosing
  &quot;Delete&quot; from the popup menu. If you use this latter
  method, it is not necessary to select the element first.
<p>
  To learn more about the different kinds of interface elements, refer
  to the chart below.

    <td>
      A button is either <em>once</em> or <em>forever</em>. When you click
      on a once button, it executes its instructions once. The forever
      button executes the instructions over and over, until you click
      on the button again to stop the action. If you have assigned an
      action key to the button, pressing the corresponding keyboard key
      will act just like a button press when the button is in focus.
      Buttons with action keys have a letter in the upper right corner
      of the button to show what the action key is. If the keyboard
      focus is in another interface element such as the Command Center,
      pressing the action key won't trigger the button. The letter
      in the upper right hand corner of the button will be dimmed in
      this situation. To enable action keys, click in the white
      background of the Interface tab.

    <td>
      Sliders are global variables, which are accessible by all agents.
      They are used in models as a quick way to change a variable
      without having to recode the procedure every time. Instead, the
      user moves the slider to a value and observes what happens in the
      model.
    </td>

      Input boxes can be set to check the syntax of a string for
      commands or reporters. Number input boxes read any type of
      constant number reporter which allows a more open way to express
      numbers than a slider. Color input boxes offer a NetLogo color
      chooser.

<p>
  The other controls in the Interface toolbar allow you to control the
  view updates and various other model properties.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image003.gif">
<ul>
  <li>The slider lets you control how fast the model runs. Slower can
  be valuable since some models run so fast they're hard to follow.
  You can also fast-forward the model by moving the slider to the
  right, reducing the frequency of view updates.
  <li>The view updates checkbox controls whether view updates happen at
  all.
  <li>The update mode menu allows you to switch between continuous and
  tick-based updates.
  <li>The &quot;Settings...&quot; button allows you to change model
  settings.
  </ul>
<p>
  &quot;Continuous&quot; updates means that NetLogo updates (that is,
  redraws) the view many times a second, regardless of what is going on
  in the model. &quot;Tick-based&quot; updates means that the view only
  updates when the tick counter advances. (For a fuller discussion of
  view updates, see the <a href="programming.html">Programming
  Guide</a>.)
<h2>
  <a>The 2D and 3D views</a>
</h2>
<p id="views">
  The large black square in the Interface tab is the 2D view. It's
  a visual representation of the NetLogo world of turtles and patches.
  Initially it's all black because the patches are black and there
  are no turtles yet. You can open the 3D View, an alternate visual
  representation of the world, by right clicking (ctrl-clicking on Mac)
  on the View and choosing &quot;Switch to 3D View&quot; (this option
  is also available in the "Tools" menu).
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/open3d-context.gif">
<p>
  There are a number of settings for the View (accessible by editing the View,
  or by pressing the &quot;Settings...&quot; button in the Interface
  Toolbar):
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/settings.gif">
<p>
  Notice that the settings are broken up into three groups. There are
  world, view, and ticks counter settings. World settings affect the
  properties of the world that the turtles live in (changing them may
  require resetting the world). View and tick counter settings only
  affect the appearance, changing them will not affect the outcome of
  the model.
<p>
  The world settings allow you to define the boundaries and topology of
  the world. At the top of the left side of the world panel you can
  choose a location for the origin of the world either
  &quot;Center&quot;, &quot;Corner&quot;, &quot;Edge&quot;, or
  &quot;Custom&quot;. By default the world has a center configuration
  where (0,0) is at the center of the world and you define the number
  of patches from the center to the right and left boundaries and the
  number of patches from the center to the top and bottom boundaries.
  For example: if you set Max-Pxcor = 10, then Min-Pxcor will
  automatically be set to -10, thus there are 10 patches to the left of
  the origin and 10 patches to the right of patch 0 0, for a total of
  21 patches in each row.
<p>
  A Corner configuration allows you to define the location of the
  origin as one of the corners of the world, upper left, upper right,
  lower left, or lower right. Then you define the far boundary in the x
  and y directions. For example if you choose to put the origin in the
  lower left corner of the world you define the right and top
  (positive) boundaries.
<p>
  Edge mode allows you to place the origin along one of the edges (x or
  y) then define the far boundary in that direction and both boundaries
  in the other. For example if you select edge mode along the bottom of
  the world, you must also define the top boundary, as well as the left
  and the right.
<p>
  Finally, Custom mode allows you to place the origin at any location
  in the world, though patch 0 0 must still exist in the world.
<p>
  As you change the settings you will notice that the changes you make
  are reflected in the preview on the right side of the panel which
  shows the origin and the boundaries. The width and height of the
  world are displayed below the preview.
<p>
  Also below the preview there are two checkboxes, the world wrap
  settings. These allow you to control the topology of the world.
  Notice when you click the check boxes the preview indicates which
  directions allow wrapping, and the name of the topology is displayed
  next to the world dimensions. See the <a href="programming.html#topology">Topology section of the Programming
  Guide</a> for more information.
<p>
  The view settings allow you to customize the look of the view without
  changing the world. Changing view settings will never force a world
  reset. To change the size of the 2D View adjust the &quot;Patch
  Size&quot; setting, measured in pixels. This does not change the
  number of patches, only how large the patches appear in the 2D View.
  (Note that the patch size does not affect the 3D View, as you can
  simply make the 3D View larger by making the window larger.)
<p>
  The font size setting lets you control the size of turtle, patch, and
  link labels.
<p>
  The frame rate controls how often the view gets updated. This can
  have a dramatic effect on the default speed at which a model runs.
  For more details, see the <a href="programming.html#updates">view
  updates section</a> of the Programming Guide.
<p>
  The &quot;Smooth edges&quot; checkbox controls the use of
  anti-aliasing in the 3D view only and only appears when editing from
  the 3D view. Unchecking it makes lines appear more jagged but may
  speed up rendering.
<p>
  Tick counter settings control the appearance of the tick counter
  which is visible (or not) in the view control strip.
<p>
  Turtle, patch and link monitors are easily available through the
  View, just right-click on the turtle or patch you want to inspect,
  and choose &quot;inspect turtle ...&quot; or &quot;inspect patch
  ...&quot; from the popup menu. You can also watch, follow or ride a
  turtle by selecting the appropriate item in the turtle sub-menu.
  (Turtle, patch and link monitors can also be opened from the Tools
  menu or by using the <a href="dictionary.html#inspect"><code>inspect</code></a> command.)
<p>
  Some NetLogo models let you interact with the turtles and patches
  with your mouse by clicking and dragging in the View.
<h3>
  Manipulating the 3D View
</h3>
<p>
  At the bottom of the window there are buttons to move the observer,
  or change the perspective from which you are looking at the world.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image024.gif">
<p>
  A blue cross appears at the current focus point as you adjust these
  settings. The little blue triangle will always point along the y-axis
  in the positive direction, so you can orient yourself in case you get
  lost.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image025.gif">
<p>
  To look at the world from a different angle, press the
  &quot;rotate&quot; button, then click and drag the mouse. The
  observer will continue to face the same point as before (where the
  blue cross is) but its position in the relation to the xy-plane will
  change.
<p>
  To move closer or farther away from the world or the agent you are
  watching, following or riding, press the &quot;zoom&quot; button and
  drag up and down. Note when you are in follow or ride mode zooming
  will switch you between ride and follow, since ride is just a special
  case of follow where the distance at which you are following is 0.
<p>
  To change the position of the observer without changing the direction
  it is facing select the &quot;move&quot; button and drag the mouse
  inside the 3D View while holding down the mouse button.
<p>
  To allow the mouse position and state to be passed to the model
  select the &quot;interact&quot; button and it will function just as
  the mouse does in the 2D view.
<p>
  To return the observer and focus point to their default positions
  press the &quot;Reset Perspective&quot; button (or use the <a href="dictionary.html#reset-perspective"><code>reset-perspective</code></a>
  command).
<h4 class="minor-section-header">Fullscreen Mode</h4>
  To enter fullscreen mode, press the &quot;Full Screen&quot; button,
  to exit fullscreen mode, press the Esc key.
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Fullscreen mode doesn't work on every computer. It
  depends on your graphics card. See the <a href="requirements.html#threed">System Requirements</a> for details.

<h4 class="minor-section-header">3D Shapes</h4>
  Some shapes are automatically mapped to true 3D counterparts in the
  3D view. For example, the 2D circle shape becomes a sphere in the 3D
  view.
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Shape name</th>
    <th>3D shape</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>default</td>
    <td>3D turtle shape</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>circle</td>
    <td>sphere</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dot</td>
    <td>small sphere</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>square</td>
    <td>cube</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>triangle</td>
    <td>cone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>line</td>
    <td>3D line</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cylinder</td>
    <td>3D cylinder</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>line-half</td>
    <td>3D line-half</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>car</td>
    <td>3D car</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  All other shapes are based on their 2D forms. If a shape is a
  rotatable shape, it is assumed to be a top view and it is extruded as
  if through a cookie cutter and oriented parallel to the xy-plane, as
  in Ants.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image026.gif">
<p>
  Or, if a shape is non-rotatable, it is assumed to be a side view, and
  it is drawn always facing the observer, as in Wolf Sheep Predation.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image027.gif">
<h2>
  <a>Command Center</a>
</h2>
<p id="commandcenter">
  The Command Center allows you to issue commands directly, without
  adding them to the model's procedures. This is useful for
  inspecting and manipulating agents on the fly.
<p>
  (<a href="tutorial2.html">Tutorial #2: Commands</a> is an
  introduction to using commands in the Command Center.)
<p>
  Let's take a look at the design of the Command Center.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image006.gif">
  <!--<p>You will notice there is a large display box, an agent popup menu
(observer&gt;), a "clear" button, a button (with the double-headed arrow)
to relocate the command center to
the right side of the window, and the history popup menu (in the lower
right, with the little
black triangle).-->
<p>
  The smaller box, below the large box, is where you type a command.
  After typing it press the Return or Enter key to run it.
<p>
  To the left of where you type is a popup menu that initially says
  &quot;observer&gt;&quot;. You can choose either observer, turtles, or
  patches, to specify which agents run the command you type.
<p>
  Tip: a quicker way to change agent types is to use the Tab key.
<h4 class="minor-section-header">Reporters</h4>
  If you enter a reporter into the Command Center, the <a href="dictionary.html#show">show</a> command will be inserted before it
  automatically.
<h4 class="minor-section-header">Accessing previous commands</h4>
  After you type a command, it appears in the large scrolling box above
  the command line. You can use Copy on the Edit menu in this area to
  copy commands and then paste them elsewhere, such as the Code tab.
<p>
  You can also access previous commands using the history popup, which
  is the small downward pointing triangle to the right of where you
  type commands. Click on the triangle and a menu of previously typed
  commands appears, so you can pick one to use again.
<p>
  Tip: a quicker way to access previous commands is with the up and
  down arrow keys on your keyboard.
<h4 class="minor-section-header">Clearing</h4>
  To clear the large scrolling area containing previous commands and
  output, click &quot;clear&quot; in the top right corner.
<p>
  To clear the history popup menu, choose &quot;Clear History&quot; on
  that menu.
<h4 class="minor-section-header">Arranging</h4>
  You can hide and show the command center using the Hide Command
  Center and Show Command Center items on the Tools menu.
<p>
  To resize the command center, drag the bar that separates it from the
  model interface. Or, click one of the little arrows on the right end
  of the bar to make the command center either very big or hidden
  altogether.
<p>
  To switch between a vertical command center and a horizontal one,
  click the button with the double-headed arrow, just to the left of
  &quot;Clear&quot;.
<h2>
  <a>Plots</a>
</h2>
<p id="plots">
  When the mouse pointer is over the white area of a plot, the x and y
  coordinates of the mouse location appear. (Note that the mouse
  location might not correspond exactly to any actual data points in
  the plot. If you need to know the exact coordinates of plotted
  points, use the Export Plot menu item and inspect the resulting file
  in another program.)
<p>
  When you create a plot, as with all widgets, the edit dialog
  automatically appears.
<p>
  <img src="./images/interface/plot.gif" alt="Plot Editor">
<p>
  Many of the fields are fairly self-explanatory, such as the name of
  the plot, labels for the x and y axes, ranges for the axes, and the
  &quot;Show legend?&quot; checkbox.
<p>
  If Auto Scale? is checked the x and y changes will automatically
  readjust as points are added to the plot if they are outside the
  current range.
<p>
  Under &quot;Plot setup commands&quot; and &quot;Plot update
  commands&quot; you can enter commands that will automatically be run
  at appropriate times. Click the little triangle to open the text box
  for the commands. Plot commands are explained in more detail in the
  Plotting section of the Programming Guide.
<h3>
  Plot Pens
</h3>
<p>
  In the plot pens section of the dialog, you can create and customize
  your plot's pens. Each table row represents a pen. By default
  there is one pen named &quot;default&quot;. (You may wish to change
  it to a name that has meaning in your model.)
<p>
  To edit the color of a pen click the colored rectangle to the left of
  the pen's name. This will bring up a dialog that allows you to
  set the color to one of the NetLogo base hues or a custom color using
  the color swatches.
<p>
  To edit the pen's name, double click the name.
<p>
  In the &quot;Pen Update Commands&quot; column you can enter commands
  that will be run when <code>reset-ticks</code>, <code>tick</code>, or
  <code>update-plots</code> commands are run. This is explained in more
  detail in the Plotting section of the Programming Guide.
<p>
  The last column has two buttons. Clicking the pencil icon will bring
  up an edit dialog with additional pen settings. The trash can button
  deletes the pen.
<h4 class="minor-section-header">Plot Pen Advanced Settings</h4>
<p>
  Clicking a pen's edit button will open this dialog:
<p>
  <img src="./images/interface/plot-pen-advanced.gif" alt="Plot Editor">
<ul>
  <li>Mode allows you to change the appearance of the plot pen: line,
  bar (for a bar chart), or point (a scatter plot of individual
  points).
  <li>Interval is the amount by which x advances every time you use the
  <code>plot</code> command.
  <li>If the &quot;Show in legend&quot; checkbox is checked the
  selected pen will be a part of the legend in the upper right hand
  corner of the plot.
  <li>In the &quot;Setup commands&quot; field you can enter commands
  that will be run when <code>reset-ticks</code> or
  <code>setup-plots</code> runs.
  <li>In the &quot;Update commands&quot; field you can enter commands
  that will be run when <code>tick</code> or <code>update-plots</code>
  runs. This field reappears in the advanced dialog to provide space
  for editing lengthier sets of commands.
  </ul>
<p>
  For more detailed information on how each of these features works you
  can see the Plotting Section of the Programming Guide.
<h2>
  <a>Sliders</a>
</h2>
<p id="sliders">
  A slider has an associated global variable. Moving the slider changes
  the variable's value.
<p>
  When you place a slider in the Interface tab the edit dialog
  automatically opens, as with all widgets. Most of the fields will be
  familiar. However, it is important to notice the minimum, maximum and
  increment fields will take any reporter, not just constants. So, for
  example, you could make the minimum <a href="dictionary.html#min-pcor"><code>min-pxcor</code></a> and the maximum
  <a href="dictionary.html#max-pcor"><code>max-pxcor</code></a> and the
  slider bounds will automatically adjust when you change the size of
  the world.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/sliderbounds.gif">
<h2>
  <a>Agent Monitors</a>
</h2>
<p id="agentmonitors">
  Agent monitors display both the values of all the variables for a
  particular agent and a mini-view that shows the agent and a small
  area around it.
<p>
  You can open agent monitors through the Tools menu or the <a href="dictionary.html#inspect"><code>inspect</code></a> command.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/agentmonitor1.gif">
<p>
  You can zoom in or out using the slider beneath the view and you can
  <a href="dictionary.html#watch"><code>watch</code></a> the agent in the
  main view using the <code>watch-me</code> button.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/agentmonitor2.gif">
<p>
  Below the slider the current value of each agent variable is
  displayed. You can enter a new value. It will be as if, for example,
  the code <code>set pcolor ...</code> had run.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/agentmonitor3.gif">
<p>
  Below the agent variable area there is a mini-command center. Rather
  than running code as the observer, or talking to all of the turtles,
  patches, or links, the code entered in this command center is run
  only by this agent.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/agentmonitor4.gif">
<p>
  You can close an agent monitor by clicking the box in the upper left
  corner, or by pressing the Esc key. If you hold down shift while you
  click the box all open agent monitors will close or you can close all
  the agent monitors using the &quot;Close All Monitors&quot; option in
  the Tools Menu.
