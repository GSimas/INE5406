    <p>
      The Turtle and Link Shape Editors allows you to create and save
      turtle and link designs.
    <p>
      NetLogo uses fully scalable and rotatable vector shapes, which means
      you can create designs by combining basic geometric elements, which
      can appear on-screen in any size or orientation.
    <h2>
      Getting started
    </h2>
    <p>
      To begin making shapes, choose <b>Turtle Shapes Editor</b> or <b>Link
      Shapes Editor</b> in the Tools menu. A new window will open listing
      all the shapes currently in the model, beginning with <i>default</i>,
      the default shape. The Shapes Editor allows you to edit shapes,
      create new shapes, and borrow from another model. You can also import
      turtle shapes from a library of pre-existing shapes.
    <h3>
      Importing shapes
    </h3>
    <p>
      Every new model in NetLogo starts off containing a small core set of
      frequently used shapes. Many more turtle shapes are available by
      using the <b>Import from library...</b> button. This brings up a
      dialog where you can select one or more shapes and bring them into
      your model. Select the shapes, then press the <b>Import</b> button.
    <p>
      Similarly, you can use the <b>Import from model...</b> button to
      borrow shapes from another model.
    <p>
      <b>Default shapes</b>
    <p>
      Here are the turtle shapes that are included by default in every new
      NetLogo model:
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/shapes1.gif">
    <p>
      First row: default, airplane, arrow, box, bug, butterfly, car
      <br>
      Second row: circle, circle 2, cow, cylinder, dot, face happy, face
      neutral
      <br>
      Third row: face sad, fish, flag, flower, house, leaf, line
      <br>
      Fourth row: line half, pentagon, person, plant, sheep, square, square
      2
      <br>
      Fifth row: star, target, tree, triangle, triangle 2, truck, turtle
      <br>
      Sixth row: wheel, x
    <p>
      <b>Shapes library</b>
    <p>
      And here are the shapes in the shapes library (including all of the
      default shapes, too):
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/shapes2.gif">
    <p>
      By default there is only one Link shape in a model, that is
      &quot;default&quot;. This shape is simply a single straight line with
      a simple arrowhead (if the link happens to be directed).
    <p class="screenshot">

    <h2>
      Creating and editing turtle shapes
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pressing the <b>New</b> button will make a new shape. Or, you may
      select an existing shape and press <b>Edit</b>.
    <h3>
      Tools
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the upper left corner of the editing window is a group of drawing
      tools. The arrow is the selection tool, which selects an already
      drawn element.
    <p>
      To draw a new element, use one of the other seven tools:
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>line</b> tool draws line segments.
      <li>The <b>circle</b>, <b>square</b>, and <b>polygon</b> tools come
      in two versions, solid and outline.
      </ul>
    <p>
      When using the polygon tool, click the mouse to add a new segment to
      the polygon. When you're done adding segments, double click.
    <p>
      After you draw a new element, it is selected, so you can move,
      delete, or reshape it if you want:
    <ul>
      <li>To move it, drag it with the mouse
      <li>To delete it, press the Delete button.
      <li>To reshape it, drag the small &quot;handles&quot; that appear on
      the element only when it is selected.
      <li>To change its color, click on the new color.
      </ul>
    <h3>
      Previews
    </h3>
    <p>
      As you draw your shape, you will also see it in five smaller sizes in
      the five preview areas found near the bottom of the editing window.
      The previews show your shape as it might appear in your model,
      including how it looks as it rotates. The number below each preview
      is the size of the preview in pixels. When you edit the view, patch
      size is also measured in pixels. So for example, the preview with
      &quot;20&quot; below it shows you how your shape would look on a
      turtle (of size 1) on patches of size 20 pixels.
    <p>
      The rotatable feature can be turned off if you want a shape that
      always faces the same way, regardless of the turtle's heading.
    <h3>
      Overlapping shapes
    </h3>
    <p>
      New elements go on top of previous elements. You can change the
      layering order by selecting an element and then using the <b>Bring to
      front</b> and <b>Send to back</b> buttons.
    <h3>
      Undo
    </h3>
    <p>
      At any point you can use the <b>Undo</b> button to undo the edit you
      just performed.
    <h3>
      Colors
    </h3>
    <p>
      Elements whose color matches the <i>Color that changes</i> (selected
      from a drop-down menu -- the default is gray) will change color
      according to the value of each turtle's <i>color</i> variable in
      your model. Elements of other colors don't change. For example,
      you could create cars that always have yellow headlights and black
      wheels, but different body colors.
    <h3>
      Other buttons
    </h3>
    <p>
      The &quot;Rotate Left&quot; and &quot;Rotate Right&quot; buttons
      rotate elements by 90 degrees. The &quot;Flip Horizontal&quot; and
      &quot;Flip Vertical&quot; buttons reflect elements across the axes.
    <p>
      These four buttons will rotate or flip the entire shape, unless an
      element is selected, in which case only that element is affected.
    <p>
      These buttons are especially handy in conjunction with the
      &quot;Duplicate&quot; button if you want to make shapes that are
      symmetrical. For example, if you were making a butterfly, you could
      draw the butterfly's left wing with the polygon tool, then
      duplicate the wing with the &quot;Duplicate&quot; button, then turn
      the copy into a right wing with the &quot;Flip Horizontal&quot;
      button.
    <h3>
      Shape design
    </h3>
    <p>
      It's tempting to draw complicated, interesting shapes, but
      remember that in most models, the patch size is so small that you
      won't be able to see very much detail. Simple, bold, iconic
      shapes are usually best.
    <h3>
      Keeping a shape
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the shape is done, give it a name and press the <b>Done</b>
      button at the bottom of the editing window. The shape and its name
      will now be included in the list of shapes along with the
      &quot;default&quot; shape.
    <h2>
      Creating and editing link shapes
    </h2>
    <p>
      Managing link shapes is very similar to managing turtle shapes. So,
      you can create a new shape by pressing the <b>New</b> button or you
      can edit existing shapes. When you are done editing a shape press
      <b>Done</b> if you want to keep it.
    <h3>
      Changing link shape properties
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are several different properties for each link shape that you
      are allowed to change:
    <ul>
      <li>Name - link shapes can have the same name as turtle shapes but
      must be unique among link shapes.
      <li>Direction Indicator - the direction indicator (the little arrow
      on directed links) is just like the turtle vector shapes, you can
      edit it using the same editor by pressing the <b>Edit</b> button.
      <li>Curviness - this is the amount of bend in a link expressed in
      patches (this is particularly useful if you have directed links going
      in both directions so you can discern both links)
      <li>Number of lines: You can have 1, 2, or 3 lines in each link
      shape, you control this by selecting line patterns in the &quot;left
      line&quot;, &quot;middle line&quot;, and &quot;right line&quot;
      selection boxes.
      <li>Dash pattern of lines: There are several dashed line patterns
      available in the selection boxes so not all lines need be solid.
      </ul>
    <p>
      Here are some link shapes with various properties:
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/linkshapes.gif">
    <h2>
      Using shapes in a model
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the model's code or in the command center, you can use any of
      the shapes that are in the model (though only turtles can have turtle
      shapes and only links can have link shapes). For example, suppose you
      want to create 50 turtles with the shape &quot;rabbit&quot;. Provided
      there is some turtle shape called <i>rabbit</i> in this model, give
      this command to the observer in the command center:
    <pre>
observer&gt; crt 50
</pre>
    <p>
      And then give these commands to the turtles to spread them out, then
      change their shape:
    <pre>
turtles&gt; fd random 15
turtles&gt; set shape &quot;rabbit&quot;
</pre>
    <p>
      Voila! Rabbits! Note the use of double quotes around the shape name.
      Shape names are strings.
    <p>
      Similarly, you can set the shape variable of links. Assuming there is
      a link shape called &quot;road&quot; in this model:
    <pre>
observer&gt; crt 5 [ create-links-with other turtles ]
turtles&gt; fd 5
links&gt; set shape &quot;road&quot;
</pre>
    <p>
      The <code>set-default-shape</code> command is also useful for
      assigning shapes to turtles and links.
