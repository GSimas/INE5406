 <p> If run by a turtle, reports the turtle at the other end of the asking link. </p>
 <p> If run by a link, reports the turtle at the end of the link that isn't the asking turtle. </p>
 <p> These definitions are difficult to understand in the abstract, but the following examples should help: </p>
 <pre>
ask turtle 0 [ create-link-with turtle 1 ]
ask turtle 0 [ ask link 0 1 [ show other-end ] ] ;; prints turtle 1
ask turtle 1 [ ask link 0 1 [ show other-end ] ] ;; prints turtle 0
ask link 0 1 [ ask turtle 0 [ show other-end ] ] ;; prints turtle 1
</pre> 
 <p> As these examples hopefully make plain, the "other" end is the end that is neither asking nor being asked. </p>
