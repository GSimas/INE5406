 <h4> <span class="prim_example">diffuse <i>patch-variable</i> <i>number</i></span> <img alt="Observer Command" src="../images/observer.gif"> </h4> 
 <p> Tells each patch to give equal shares of (<i>number</i> * 100) percent of the value of <i>patch-variable</i> to its eight neighboring patches. <i>number</i> should be between 0 and 1. Regardless of topology the sum of <i>patch-variable</i> will be conserved across the world. (If a patch has fewer than eight neighbors, each neighbor still gets an eighth share; the patch keeps any leftover shares.) </p>
 <p> Note that this is an observer command only, even though you might expect it to be a patch command. (The reason is that it acts on all the patches at once -- patch commands act on individual patches.) </p>
 <pre>
diffuse chemical 0.5
;; each patch diffuses 50% of its variable
;; chemical to its neighboring 8 patches. Thus,
;; each patch gets 1/8 of 50% of the chemical
;; from each neighboring patch.)
