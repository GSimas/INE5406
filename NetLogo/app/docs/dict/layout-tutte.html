 <h4> <span class="prim_example">layout-tutte <i>turtle-set</i> <i>link-set</i> <i>radius</i></span> </h4> 
 <p> The turtles that are connected by links in <i>link-set</i> but not included in <i>turtle-set</i> are placed in a circle layout with the given <i>radius</i>. There should be at least 3 agents in this agentset. </p>
 <p> The turtles in <i>turtle-set</i> are then laid out in the following manner: Each turtle is placed at centroid (or barycenter) of the polygon formed by its linked neighbors. (The centroid is like a 2-dimensional average of the coordinates of the neighbors.) </p>
 <p> (The purpose of the circle of "anchor agents" is to prevent all the turtles from collapsing down to one point.) </p>
 <p> After a few iterations of this, the layout will stabilize. </p>
 <p> This layout is named after the mathematician William Thomas Tutte, who proposed it as a method for graph layout. </p>
