 <h3> <a>who</a> </h3> 
 <h4> <span class="prim_example">who</span> <img alt="Turtle Command" src="../images/turtle.gif"> </h4> 
 <p> This is a built-in turtle variable. It holds the turtle's "who number" or ID number, an integer greater than or equal to zero. You cannot set this variable; a turtle's who number never changes. </p>
 <p> Who numbers start at 0. A dead turtle's number will not be reassigned to a new turtle until you use the <a href="../dictionary.html#clear-turtles">clear-turtles</a> or <a href="../dictionary.html#clear-all">clear-all</a> commands, at which time who numbering starts over again at 0. </p>
 <p> Example: </p>
 <pre>
show [who] of turtles with [color = red]
;; prints a list of the who numbers of all red turtles
;; in the Command Center, in random order
crt 100
  [ ifelse who &lt; 50
      [ set color red ]
      [ set color blue ] ]
;; turtles 0 through 49 are red, turtles 50
;; through 99 are blue
</pre> 
 <p> You can use the turtle reporter to retrieve a turtle with a given who number. See also <a href="../dictionary.html#turtle">turtle</a>. </p>
 <p> Note that who numbers aren't breed-specific. No two turtles can have the same who number, even if they are different breeds: </p>
 <pre>
clear-turtles
create-frogs 1
create-mice 1
ask turtles [ print who ]
;; prints (in some random order):
;; (frog 0): 0
;; (mouse 1): 1
</pre> 
 <p> Even though we only have one mouse, it is <code>mouse 1</code> not <code>mouse 0</code>, because the who number 0 was already taken by the frog. </p>
