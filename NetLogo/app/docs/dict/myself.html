 <p> "self" and "myself" are very different. "self" is simple; it means "me". "myself" means "the turtle, patch or link who asked me to do what I'm doing right now." </p>
 <p> When an agent has been asked to run some code, using myself in that code reports the agent (turtle, patch or link) that did the asking. </p>
 <p> myself is most often used in conjunction with <code>of</code> to read or set variables in the asking agent. </p>
 <p> myself can be used within blocks of code not just in the ask command, but also hatch, sprout, of, with, all?, with-min, with-max, min-one-of, max-one-of, min-n-of, max-n-of. </p>
 <pre>
ask turtles
  [ ask patches in-radius 3
      [ set pcolor [color] of myself ] ]
;; each turtle makes a colored "splotch" around itself
