 <p> Reports the x-increment or y-increment (the amount by which the turtle's xcor or ycor would change) if the turtle were to take one step forward in its current heading. </p>
 <p> Note: dx is simply the sine of the turtle's heading, and dy is simply the cosine. (If this is the reverse of what you expected, it's because in NetLogo a heading of 0 is north and 90 is east, which is the reverse of how angles are usually defined in geometry.) </p>
 <p> Note: In earlier versions of NetLogo, these primitives were used in many situations where the new <code>patch-ahead</code> primitive is now more appropriate.
