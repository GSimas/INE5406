 <p> Reports a sorted list of numbers, strings, or agents. </p>
 <p> If the input contains no numbers, strings, or agents, the result is the empty list. </p>
 <p> If the input contains at least one number, the numbers in the list are sorted in ascending order and a new list reported; non-numbers are ignored. </p>
 <p> Or, if the input contains at least one string, the strings in the list are sorted in ascending order and a new list reported; non-strings are ignored. </p>
 <p> Or, if the input is an agentset or a list containing at least one agent, a sorted list of agents (never an agentset) is reported; non-agents are ignored. Agents are sorted in the same order the &lt; operator uses. (Patches are sorted with the top left-most patch first and the bottom right-most patch last, turtles are sorted by <code>who</code> number). </p>
 <pre>
show sort [3 1 4 2]
=&gt; [1 2 3 4]
show sort [2 1 "a"]
=&gt; [1 2]
show sort (list "a" "c" "b" (patch 0 0))
=&gt; ["a" "b" "c"]
show sort (list (patch 0 0) (patch 0 1) (patch 1 0))
=&gt; [(patch 0 1) (patch 0 0) (patch 1 0)]

;; label patches with numbers in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order
let n 0
foreach sort patches [ the-patch -&gt;
  ask the-patch [
    set plabel n
    set n n + 1
  ]
]

;; some additional examples to clarify behavior in strange cases
show sort (list patch 0 0 patch 0 1 patch 1 0 turtle 0 turtle 1) ; turtles are always sorted lower than patches
=&gt; [(turtle 0) (turtle 1) (patch 0 1) (patch 0 0) (patch 1 0)]
show sort (list nobody false true) ; booleans and nobody cannot be sorted
=&gt; []
show sort (list [1 2 3] turtles) ; lists and agentsets are not included if they are inside a list passed to sort
=&gt; []
