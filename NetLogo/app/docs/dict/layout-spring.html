 <p> Arranges the turtles in <i>turtle-set</i>, as if the links in <i>link-set</i> are springs and the turtles are repelling each other. Turtles that are connected by links in <i>link-set</i> but not included in <i>turtle-set</i> are treated as anchors and are not moved. </p>
 <p> <i>spring-constant</i> is a measure of the "tautness" of the spring. It is the "resistance" to change in their length. spring-constant is the force the spring would exert if it's length were changed by 1 unit. </p>
 <p> spring-length is the "zero-force" length or the natural length of the springs. This is the length which all springs try to achieve either by pushing out their nodes or pulling them in. </p>
 <p> repulsion-constant is a measure of repulsion between the nodes. It is the force that 2 nodes at a distance of 1 unit will exert on each other. </p>
 <p> The repulsion effect tries to get the nodes as far as possible from each other, in order to avoid crowding and the spring effect tries to keep them at "about" a certain distance from the nodes they are connected to. The result is the laying out of the whole network in a way which highlights relationships among the nodes and at the same time is crowded less and is visually pleasing. </p>
 <p> The layout algorithm is based on the Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm. More information about this algorithm can be obtained <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.13.8444" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
