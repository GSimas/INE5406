 <p> This reporter lets you give a turtle a "cone of vision" in front of itself. The cone is defined by the two inputs, the vision distance (radius) and the viewing angle. The viewing angle may range from 0 to 360 and is centered around the turtle's current heading. (If the angle is 360, then in-cone is equivalent to in-radius.) </p>
 <p> in-cone reports an agentset that includes only those agents from the original agentset that fall in the cone. (This can include the agent itself.) </p>
 <p> The distance to a patch is measured from the center of the patch. </p>

;; each turtle makes a red "splotch" of patches in a 60 degree
;; cone of radius 3 ahead of itself
