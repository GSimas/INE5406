 <p> Reads the values of all variables for a model, both built-in and user-defined, including all observer, turtle, and patch variables, from an external file named by the given string. The file should be in the format used by the <a href="../dictionary.html#export-cmds">export-world</a> primitive. </p>
 <p> Note that the functionality of this primitive is also directly available from NetLogo's File menu. </p>
 <p> When using import-world, to avoid errors, perform these steps in the following order: </p>
 <ol> 
  <li>Open the model from which you created the export file. </li>
  <li>Press the Setup button, to get the model in a state from which it can be run. </li>
  <li>Import the file. </li>
  <li>Re-open any files that the model had opened with the <code>file-open</code> command. </li>
  <li>If you want, press Go button to continue running the model from the point where it left off. </li>
 </ol> 
 <p> If you wish to import a file from a location other than the model's location, you may include the full path to the file you wish to import. See <a href="../dictionary.html#export-cmds">export-world</a> for an example. </p>
