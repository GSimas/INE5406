 <p> Reports a subset of the given agentset that includes only the agents on the patches the given distances away from this agent. The distances are specified as a list of three-item lists, where the three items are the x, y, and z offsets. </p>
 <p> If the caller is the observer, then the points are measured relative to the origin, in other words, the points are taken as absolute patch coordinates. </p>
 <p> If the caller is a turtle, the points are measured relative to the turtle's exact location, and not from the center of the patch under the turtle. </p>
