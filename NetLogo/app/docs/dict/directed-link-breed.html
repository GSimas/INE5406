 <p> This keyword, like the globals and breeds keywords, can only be used at the beginning of the Code tab, before any procedure definitions. It defines a directed link breed. Links of a particular breed are always all directed or all undirected The first input defines the name of the agentset associated with the link breed. The second input defines the name of a single member of the breed. Directed links can be created using <a href="../dictionary.html#create-link">create-link(s)-to</a>, and <a href="../dictionary.html#create-link">create-link(s)-from</a>, but not <code>create-link(s)-with</code> </p>
 <p> Any link of the given link breed: </p>
 <ul> 
  <li>is part of the agentset named by the link breed name </li>
  <li>has its built-in variable <code>breed</code> set to that agentset </li>
  <li>is directed or undirected as declared by the keyword </li>
 </ul> 
 <p> Most often, the agentset is used in conjunction with ask to give commands to only the links of a particular breed. </p>
