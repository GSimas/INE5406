 <h3> <a>every<span class="since">1.0</span></a> </h3> 
 <h4> <span class="prim_example">every <i>number</i> [ <i>commands</i> ]</span> </h4> 
 <p> Runs the given commands only if it's been more than <i>number</i> seconds since the last time this agent ran them in this context. Otherwise, the commands are skipped. </p>
 <p> By itself, every doesn't make commands run over and over again. You need to use every inside a loop, or inside a forever button, if you want the commands run over and over again. every only limits how often the commands run. </p>
 <p> Above, "in this context" means during the same ask (or button press or command typed in the Command Center). So it doesn't make sense to write <code>ask turtles [ every 0.5 [ ... ] ]</code>, because when the ask finishes the turtles will all discard their timers for the "every". The correct usage is shown below. </p>
 <pre>
every 0.5 [ ask turtles [ fd 1 ] ]
;; twice a second the turtles will move forward 1
every 2 [ set index index + 1 ]
;; every 2 seconds index is incremented
</pre>
