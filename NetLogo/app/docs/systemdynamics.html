    <h2>
      <a id="what">What is the NetLogo System Dynamics
      Modeler?</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      System Dynamics is a type of modeling where you try to understand how
      things relate to one another. It is a little different from the
      agent-based approach we normally use in NetLogo models.
    <p>
      With the agent-based approach we usually use in NetLogo, you program
      the behavior of individual agents and watch what emerges from their
      interaction. In a model of Wolf-Sheep Predation, for example, you
      provide rules for how wolves, sheep and grass interact with each
      other. When you run the simulation, you watch the emergent
      aggregate-level behavior: for example, how the populations of wolves
      and sheep change over time.
    <p>
      With the System Dynamics Modeler, you don't program the behavior
      of individual agents. Instead, you program how populations of agents
      behave as a whole. For example, using System Dynamics to model
      Wolf-Sheep Predation, you specify how the total number of sheep would
      change as the total number of wolves goes up or down, and vice versa.
      You then run the simulation to see how both populations change over
      time.
    <p>
      The System Dynamics Modeler allows you to draw a diagram that defines
      these populations, or &quot;stocks&quot;, and how they affect each
      other. The Modeler reads your diagram and generates the appropriate
      NetLogo code -- global variables, procedures and reporters -- to run
      your System Dynamics model inside of NetLogo.
    <h3>
      Basic Concepts
    </h3>
    <p>
      A System Dynamics diagram is made of four kinds of elements: Stocks,
      Variables, Flows and Links.
    <p>
      A <b>Stock</b> is a collection of stuff, an aggregate. For example, a
      Stock can represent a population of sheep, the water in a lake, or
      the number of widgets in a factory.
    <p>
      A <b>Flow</b> brings things into, or out of a Stock. Flows look like
      pipes with a faucet because the faucet controls how much stuff passes
      through the pipe.
    <p>
      A <b>Variable</b> is a value used in the diagram. It can be an
      equation that depends on other Variables, or it can be a constant.
    <p>
      A <b>Link</b> makes a value from one part of the diagram available to
      another. A link transmits a number from a Variable or a Stock into a
      Stock or a Flow.
    <p>
      The System Dynamics Modeler figures out how the value of your Stocks
      change over time by estimating them over and over. The estimation
      isn't always perfect, but you can affect its accuracy by changing
      the value of <b>dt</b>. As dt decreases, you estimate the model more
      frequently, so it gets more accurate. However, decreasing dt also
      makes the model slower.
    <h3>
      Sample Models
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are four basic models in the Sample Models section of the NetLogo
      Models Library that demonstrate the use of the System Dynamics Modeler.
      All four basic models explore population growth (and, in models with
      predation, population decline).
    <p>
      <b>Exponential Growth</b> and <b>Logistic Growth</b> are simple
      examples of growth in one stock.
    <p>
      <b>Wolf Sheep Predation (System Dynamics)</b> is an example of a system
      with multiple stocks influencing one another. It models a
      predator-prey ecosystem using the System Dynamics Modeler.
    <p>
      <b>Wolf Sheep Predation (Docked Hybrid)</b> is an example of a model that
      runs both the a System Dynamics model and an agent-based model
      side-by-side. It runs the System Dynamics implementation of
      Wolf-Sheep Predation next to the agent-based Wolf Sheep Predation
      model from the Biology section of Sample Models.

    <h3>
      Diagram Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Diagram tab is where you draw your System Dynamics diagram.
    <p>
      The toolbar contains buttons to edit, delete and create items in your
      diagram.
    <h4>
      Creating Diagram Elements
    </h4>
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/systemdynamics/elementbuttons.gif">
    <p>
      A System Dynamics diagram is made up of four kinds of components:
      Stocks, Variables, Flows and Links.
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Stock
      <dd>
        <p>
          To create a Stock, press the Stock button in the toolbar and
          click in the diagram area below. A new Stock appears. Each Stock
          requires a unique name, which becomes a global variable. Stocks
          also require an <b>Initial value</b>. It can be a number, a
          variable, a complex NetLogo expression, or a call to a NetLogo
          reporter.
        <dt>
        Variable
      <dd>
        <p>
          To create a Variable, press the Variable button and click on the
          diagram. Each Variable in the System Dynamics Model requires a
          unique name, which becomes the name of a procedure, or a global
          variable. Variables also require an <b>Expression</b>. This
          expression can be a number, a variable, a complex NetLogo
          expression, or a call to a NetLogo reporter.
        <dt>
        Flow
      <dd>
        <p>
          To create a Flow, press the Flow button. Click and hold where you
          want the Flow to begin -- either on a Stock or in an empty area
          -- and drag the mouse to where you want the Flow to end -- on a
          Stock or in an empty area. Each Flow requires a unique name,
          which becomes a NetLogo reporter. Flows require an
          <b>Expression</b>, which is the rate of flow from the input to
          the output. This expression can be a number, a variable, a
          complex NetLogo expression, or a call to a NetLogo reporter. If
          the value is negative, the flow is in the opposite direction.
        <p>
          When more than one Flow is connected to a Stock, it is important
          to consider how they should interact with one another. NetLogo
          will not enforce that the Flows out of a stock occur in any
          particular order. Also, NetLogo will not ensure that the sum of
          Flows out of a Stock are less than or equal to the value of the
          Stock. These behaviors can be implemented explicitly when
          creating the <b>Expression</b> for a Flow.
        <p>
          For example, if the Flow is defined as a constant value, 10, you
          can ensure it never draws more than the value of the Stock by
          using the <a href="dictionary.html#min"><code>min</code></a>
          primitive: <code>min (list stock 10)</code>. If I want Flow A to
          deplete a Stock before Flow B is calculated, I can link Flow A to
          Flow B and modify Flow B to subtract Flow A's value from the
          stock: <code>min (list (max (list 0 (stock - flow-a))) 10)</code>.
        <dt>
        Link
      <dd>
        <p>
          To create a Link, click and hold on the starting point for the
          link -- a Variable, Stock or Flow -- and drag the mouse to the
          destination Variable or Flow.
        </dl>
    <h4>
      Working with Diagram Elements
    </h4>
    <p>
      When you create a Stock, Variable, or Flow, you see a red
      question-mark on the element. The question-mark indicates that the
      element doesn't have a name yet. The red color indicates that the
      Stock is incomplete: it's missing one or more values required to
      generate a System Dynamics model. When a diagram element is complete,
      the name turns black.
    <p>
      <b>Selecting:</b> To select a diagram element, click on it. To select
      multiple elements, hold the shift key. You can also select one or
      more elements by dragging a selection box.
    <p>
      <b>Editing:</b> To edit a diagram element, select the element and
      press the &quot;Edit&quot; button on the toolbar. Or just
      double-click the element. (You can edit Stocks, Flows and Variables,
      but you can't edit Links).
    <p>
      <b>Moving:</b> To move a diagram element, select it and drag the
      mouse to a new location.
    <h4>
      Editing dt
    </h4>
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/systemdynamics/dt.gif">
    <p>
      On the right side of the toolbar is the default dt, the interval used
      to approximate the results of your System Dynamics model. To change
      the value of the default dt for your aggregate model, press the Edit
      button next to the dt display and enter a new value.
    <h4>
      Errors
    </h4>
    <p>
      When you click the &quot;check&quot; button or when you edit a stock,
      flow, or variable the modeler will automatically generate the NetLogo
      code the corresponds to your diagram and try to compile that code. If
      there is an error the Code tab will turn red and a message will
      appear, and the portion of the generated code that is causing the
      trouble will be highlighted.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/systemdynamics/error.gif">
    <p>
      This should give you a better idea which element in the diagram is
      causing the problem.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/systemdynamics/errordialog.jpg">
    <h3>
      Code Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      The System Dynamics Modeler generates NetLogo variables and
      procedures based on the contents of your diagram. These procedures
      are what make the diagram actually perform calculations. The Code tab
      in the System Dynamics Modeler window displays the NetLogo procedures
      generated from your diagram.
    <p>
      You can't edit the contents of the Code tab. To modify your
      System Dynamics mode, edit the diagram.
    <p>
      Let's take a closer look at how the generated code relates to the
      diagram.:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stocks correspond to a global variable that is initialized to the
          value or expression you provided in the <b>Initial value</b>
          field. Each Stock will be updated every step based on the Flows
          in and out.
        <li>
        <p>
          Flows correspond to a procedure that contains the expression you
          provided in the <b>Expression</b> field.
        <li>
        <p>
          Variables can either be global variables or procedures. If the
          <b>Expression</b> you provided is a constant it will be a global
          variable and initialized to that value. If you used a more
          complicated <b>Expression</b> to define the Variable it will
          create a procedure like a Flow.
        </ul>
    <p>
      The variables and procedures defined in this tab are accessible in
      the main NetLogo window, just like the variables and procedures you
      define yourself in the main NetLogo Code tab. You can call the
      procedures from the main Code tab, from the Command Center, or from
      buttons in the Interface tab. You can refer to the global variables
      anywhere, including in the main Code tab and in monitors.
    <p>
      There are three important procedures to notice:
      <code>system-dynamics-setup</code>, <code>system-dynamics-go</code>,
      and <code>system-dynamics-do-plot</code>.
    <p>
      <b><code>system-dynamics-setup</code></b> initializes the aggregate
      model. It sets the value of <code>dt</code>, calls
      <code>reset-ticks</code>, and initializes your stocks and your
      converters. Converters with a constant value are initialized first,
      followed by the stocks with constant values. The remaining stocks are
      initialized in alphabetical order.
    <p>
      <b><code>system-dynamics-go</code></b> runs the aggregate model for
      <code>dt</code> time units. It computes the values of Flows and
      Variables and updates the value of Stocks. It also calls
      <code>tick-advance</code> with the value of <code>dt</code>.
      Converters and Flows with non-constant <b>Expressions</b> will be
      calculated only once when this procedure is called, however, their
      order of evaluation is undefined
    <p>
      <b><code>system-dynamics-do-plot</code></b> plots the values of
      Stocks in the aggregate model. To use this, first create a plot in
      the main NetLogo window. You then need to define a plot pen for each
      Stock you want to be plotted. This procedure will use the current
      plot, which you can change using the <code>set-current-plot</code>
      command.
    <h3>
      The System Dynamics Modeler and NetLogo
    </h3>
    <p>
      The diagram you create with the System Dynamics Modeler, and the
      procedures generated from your diagram, are part of your NetLogo
      model. When you a save the NetLogo model, your diagram is saved with
      it, in the same file.
    <h2>

      Let's create a model of Wolf-Sheep Predation with the System
      Dynamics Modeler.
    <h3>
      Step 1: Sheep Reproduction
    </h3>
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>

    <p>
      Our model will have a population of wolves and a population of sheep.
      Let's start with the sheep. First, create a Stock that holds a
      population of Sheep.
    <div class="blockquote">

          </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Our sheep population can increase if new sheep are born. To add this
      to our diagram, we create a Flow into the stock of sheep.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Click on the Flow button in the toolbar and press the mouse
        button in an empty area to the left of the sheep Stock. Drag the
        Flow to the right until it connects to the sheep Stock and let go.
        <li>Edit the Flow and name it <code>sheep-births</code>.
        <li>For now, enter a constant, such as <code>1</code>, into the
        Expression field.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      The number of sheep born during a period of time depends on the
      number of sheep that are alive: more sheep means more reproduction.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Draw a Link from the <code>sheep</code> Stock to the
        <code>sheep-births</code> Flow.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      The rate of sheep births also depends on some constant factors that
      are beyond the scope of this model: the rate of reproduction, etc.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Create a Variable and name it <code>sheep-birth-rate</code>.
        Set its value to <code>0.04</code>
        <li>Draw a Link from the <code>sheep-birth-rate</code> Variable to
        the <code>sheep-births</code>.
        </ul>

    <p>
      Your diagram should look something like this:
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial5.png">
    <p>
      Our diagram has the correct structure but we aren't yet finished
      because it the amount of sheep flowing into the stock doesn't
      depend upon the number of sheep and sheep birth rate.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Edit the <code>sheep-births</code> Flow and set the expression

      We now have a complete diagram. To see the NetLogo code generated by
      our diagram, you can click on the Code tab of the System Dynamics

    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial8.gif">
    <h3>
      Step 2: NetLogo Integration
    </h3>
    <p>
      Once you create an aggregate model with the System Dynamics Modeler,
      you can interact with the model through the main NetLogo interface
      window. Let's build our NetLogo model to run the code generated
      by our diagram. We'll need a <code>setup</code> and
      <code>go</code> buttons which call the
      <code>system-dynamics-setup</code> and <code>system-dynamics-go
      procedures</code> created by the System Dynamics Modeler. And
      we'll want a monitor and a plot to watch the changes in sheep
      population.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Select the main NetLogo window
        <li>In the Code tab, write:
          <pre>
to setup
  ca
  system-dynamics-setup
end

to go
  system-dynamics-go
  system-dynamics-do-plot
end
</pre>
        <li>Move to the Interface tab
        <li>Create a <code>setup</code> button
        <li>Create a <code>go</code> button (don't forget to make it
        forever)
        <li>Create a <code>sheep</code> monitor.
        <li>Create a plot called &quot;populations&quot; with a pen named
        &quot;sheep&quot;.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Now we're ready to run our model.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Press the setup button.
        <li>Don't press the &quot;go&quot; button yet. Instead, type
        <code>go</code> four or five times into the Command Center
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Notice what happens. The sheep population increases exponentially.
      After four or five iterations, we have an enormous number of sheep.
      That's because we have sheep reproduction, but our sheep never
      die.
    <p>
      To fix that, let's finish our diagram by introducing a population
      of wolves which eat sheep.
