  The Code tab is where the code for the model is stored. Commands you
  only want to use immediately go in the Command Center; commands you
  want to save and use later, over and over again, are found in the
  Code tab.

<p>
  To determine if the code has any errors, you may press the
  &quot;Check&quot; button. If there are any syntax errors, the Code
  tab will turn red, the code that contains the error will be
  highlighted, and an error message will appear.

<p>
  Switching tabs also causes the code to be checked, so if you just
  switch tabs, pressing the Check button first isn't necessary.
<p>
  To find a fragment of code in the procedures, click on the
  &quot;Find&quot; button in the Code toolbar and the Find dialog will
  appear.

<p>
  You may enter a word or phrase to find, and optionally also a new
  word or phrase to replace it with. The &quot;Ignore case&quot;
  checkbox controls whether the capitalization must be the same to
  indicate a match.
<p>
  If the &quot;Wrap around&quot; checkbox is checked, the entire Code
  tab will be checked for the phrase, starting at the cursor position.
  When it reaches the end it will return to the top, otherwise only the
  area from the cursor position to the end of the Code tab will be
  searched. The &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; buttons will
  move down and up to find another occurrence of the search phrase.
<p>
  &quot;Replace&quot; changes the currently selected phrase with the
  replace phrase and &quot;Replace &amp; Find&quot; changes the
  selected phrase and moves to the next occurrence. &quot;Replace
  All&quot; will change all instances of the find phrase in the search
  area with the replace phrase.
<p>
  To find a particular procedure definition in your code, use the
  &quot;Procedures&quot; popup menu in the Code tab. The menu lists all
  procedures in alphabetical order.
<p>
  The &quot;Shift Left&quot;, &quot;Shift Right&quot;,
  &quot;Comment&quot;, and &quot;Uncomment&quot; items on the Edit menu
  are used in the Code tab to change the indentation level of your code
  or add and remove semicolons, which mark comments, from sections of
  code.
<p>
  For more information about writing procedures, read <a href="tutorial3.html">Tutorial #3: Procedures</a> and the <a href="programming.html">Programming Guide</a>.
<h2>
  <a>Included Files Menu</a>
</h2>
<p id="includes">
  <strong>Caution:</strong> The includes facility is new and experimental.
<p>
  When you add the <a href="dictionary.html#includes">__includes</a>
  keyword to a model a menu to the right of the procedures menu
  appears. This is the "Included Files" menu which lists all the NetLogo source
  files (.nls) included in this file. You can make this menu always visible
  using the Preferences dialog.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/includesmenu.gif">
<p>
  You can choose a file name from the menu to open a tab for that file,
  or you can open a new or existing file using New Source File and Open
  Source File, respectively.
<p class="screenshot">

<p>
  Once you've opened new tabs they become accessible from the Tabs
  menu, and you can use the keyboard to move from tab to tab (Command +
  number on Mac, Control + number on other operating systems).
<p class="screenshot">

<h2>
  Automatic indentation
</h2>
<p>
  When the Indent Automatically checkbox is selected, NetLogo will
  automatically attempt to align your code in a logically structured
  format. For example, when you open a set of square brackets
  &quot;[&quot; (perhaps after an <code>if</code> statement), NetLogo will
  automatically add spaces so that the following lines of code are two
  spaces further indented than the bracket. When you close the square
  brackets the closing bracket will be lined up with the matching open
  bracket.
<p class="screenshot">
  <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/tabified-code.gif">
<p>
  NetLogo will try to indent the code as you type, but you can also
  press the tab key anywhere on any line to ask NetLogo to indent the
  line immediately. Or, you can select a whole region of code and press
  the tab key to re-indent all of it.
