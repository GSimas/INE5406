  </div>

    <p>
      This tutorial leads you through the process of building a complete
      model, built up in stages, with every step explained along the way.
    <h2>
      Agents and procedures
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Tutorial #2, you learned how to use the command center and agent
      monitors to inspect and modify agents and make them do things. Now
      you're ready to learn about the real heart of a NetLogo model:
      the Code tab.
    <p>
      You've seen that agents in NetLogo are divided into patches,
      turtles, links, and the observer. Patches are stationary and arranged
      in a grid. Turtles move over that grid. Links connect two turtles.
      The observer oversees everything that's going on and does
      whatever the turtles, patches and links can't do for themselves.
    <p>
      All four types of agents can run NetLogo commands. All four can also
      run &quot;procedures&quot;. A procedure combines a series of NetLogo
      commands into a single new command that you define.
    <p>
      You will now learn to write procedures that make turtles move, eat,
      reproduce, and die. You will also learn how to make monitors,
      sliders, and plots. The model we'll build is a simple ecosystem
      model not unlike Wolf Sheep Predation from Tutorial #1.
    <h2>
      Making the setup button
    </h2>
    <p>
      To start a new model, select &quot;New&quot; from the File menu. Then
      begin by creating a setup button:
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Click the &quot;Add&quot; icon in the toolbar at the top of the
        Interface tab.
        <li>On the menu next to Add, select Button (if it isn't already
        selected).
        <li>Click wherever you want the button to appear in the empty white
        area of the Interface tab.
        <li>A dialog box for editing the button opens. Type <code>setup</code>
        in the box labeled &quot;Commands&quot;.
        <li>Press the OK button when you're done; the dialog box
        closes.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Now you have a setup button. Pressing the button runs a procedure
      called &quot;setup&quot;. A procedure is a sequence of NetLogo
      commands that we assign a new name. We'll define that procedure
      soon, but we haven't yet. The button refers to a procedure that
      doesn't exist, so the button turns red:
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/errors.gif">
    <p>
      If you want to see the actual error message, click the button.
    <p>
      Now we'll create the &quot;setup&quot; procedure, so the error
      message will go away:
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Switch to the Code tab.
        <li>Type the following:
          <pre>
to setup
  clear-all
  create-turtles 100 [ setxy random-xcor random-ycor ]
  reset-ticks
end
</pre>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      When you're done, the Code tab looks like this:
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/setupcode.gif">
    <p>
      Note that some lines are indented. Most people find it helpful to
      indent their code. It isn't mandatory, but it makes the code
      easier to read and change.
    <p>
      Your procedure begins with <a href="dictionary.html#to"><code>to</code></a> and ends with <a href="dictionary.html#end"><code>end</code></a>. Every procedure begins and
      ends with these words.
    <p>
      Let's look at what you typed in and see what each line of your
      procedure does:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>to setup</code> begins defining a procedure named
        &quot;setup&quot;.
      <li>
        <a href="dictionary.html#clear-all"><code>clear-all</code></a> resets
        the world to an initial, empty state. All the patches turn black
        and any turtles you might have created disappear. Basically, it
        wipes the slate clean for a new model run.
      <li>
        <code>create-turtles 100</code> creates 100 turtles. They start out
        standing at the origin, that is, the center of patch 0,0.
      <li>After <code>create-turtles</code> we can put commands for the new
      turtles to run, enclosed by square brackets.
      <li>
        <code>setxy random-xcor random-ycor</code> is a command using
        &quot;reporters&quot;. A reporter, as opposed to a command, reports
        a result. First each turtle runs the reporter <a href="dictionary.html#random-cor"><code>random-xcor</code></a> which will
        report a random number from the allowable range of turtle
        coordinates along the X axis. Then each turtle runs the reporter
        <a href="dictionary.html#random-cor"><code>random-ycor</code></a>,
        same for the Y axis. Finally each turtle runs the <a href="dictionary.html#setxy"><code>setxy</code></a> command with those two
        numbers as inputs. That makes the turtle move to the point with
        those coordinates.
      <li>
        <a href="dictionary.html#reset-ticks"><code>reset-ticks</code></a>
        starts the tick counter, now that setup is otherwise complete.
      <li>
        <a href="dictionary.html#end"><code>end</code></a> completes the
        definition of the &quot;setup&quot; procedure.
      </ul>
    <p>
      When you're done typing, switch to the Interface tab and press
      the setup button you made before. You will see the turtles scattered
      around the world:
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/scatter.gif">
    <p>
      Press setup a couple more times, and see how the arrangement of
      turtles is different each time. Note that some turtles may be right
      on top of each other.
    <p>
      Think a bit about what you needed to do to make this happen. You
      needed to make a button in the interface and make a procedure that
      the button uses. The button only worked once you completed both of
      these separate steps. In the remainder of this tutorial, you will
      often have to complete two or more similar steps to add another
      feature to the model. If something doesn't appear to work after
      you completed what you thought is the final step for that new
      feature, continue to read ahead to see if there is still more to do.
      After reading ahead for a couple of paragraphs, you should then go
      back over the directions to see if there is any step you might have
      missed.
    <h2>
      Switching to tick-based view updates
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now that we're using the tick counter (with
      <code>reset-ticks</code>), we should tell NetLogo that it only needs to
      update the view once per tick, instead of continuously updating it.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Find the view updates menu. It's above the view and by
        default says &quot;continuous&quot;.
        <li>Choose &quot;on ticks&quot; instead.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      This makes your model run faster and ensures a consistent appearance
      (since the updates will happen at consistent times). See the
      Programming Guide for a fuller discussion of view updates.
    <h2>
      Making the go button
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now make a button called &quot;go&quot;. Follow the same steps you
      used to make the setup button, except:
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>For Commands enter <code>go</code> instead of <code>setup</code>.
        <li>Check the &quot;Forever&quot; checkbox in the edit dialog.
        <li>Check the &quot;Disable until ticks start&quot; checkbox too.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/gobutton.gif">
    <p>
      The &quot;Forever&quot; checkbox makes the button stay down once
      pressed, so its commands run over and over again, not just once.
    <p>
      The &quot;Disable until ticks start&quot; prevents you from pressing
      go before setup.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Then add a go procedure to the Code tab:
          <pre>
to go
  move-turtles
  tick
end
</pre>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      <a href="dictionary.html#tick"><code>tick</code></a> is a primitive that
      advances the tick counter by one tick.
    <p>
      But what is <code>move-turtles</code>? Is it a primitive (in other words,
      built-in to NetLogo)? No, it's another procedure that you're
      about to add. So far, you have introduced two procedures that you
      added yourself: <code>setup</code> and <code>go</code>.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Add the <code>move-turtles</code> procedure after the
        <code>go</code>procedure:
          <pre>
to go
  move-turtles
  tick
end

to move-turtles
  ask turtles [
    right random 360
    forward 1
  ]
end
</pre>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Note there are no spaces around the hyphen in <code>move-turtles</code>.
      In Tutorial #2 we used <code>red - 2</code>, with spaces, in order to
      subtract two numbers, but here we want <code>move-turtles</code>, without
      spaces. The &quot;-&quot; combines &quot;move&quot; and
      &quot;turtles&quot; into a single name.
    <p>
      Here is what each command in the <code>move-turtles</code> procedure
      does:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>ask turtles [ ... ]</code> says that each turtle should run the
        commands in the brackets.
      <li>
        <code>right random 360</code> is another command that uses a reporter.
        First, each turtle picks a random whole number between 0 and 359.
        (<a href="dictionary.html#random"><code>random</code></a> doesn't
        include the number you give it as a possible result.) Then the
        turtle turns right this number of degrees.
      <li>
        <code>forward 1</code> makes the turtle move forward one step.
      </ul>
    <p>
      Why couldn't we have just written all of these commands in
      <code>go</code> instead of in a separate procedure? We could have, but
      during the course of building your project, it's likely that
      you'll add many other parts. We'd like to keep <code>go</code> as
      simple as possible, so that it is easy to understand. Eventually, it
      will include many other things you want to have happen as the model
      runs, such as calculating something or plotting the results. Each of
      these things to do will have its own procedure and each procedure
      will have its own unique name.
    <p>
      The 'go' button you made in the Interface tab is a forever
      button, meaning that it will continually run its commands until you
      shut it off (by clicking on it again). After you have pressed
      'setup' once, to create the turtles, press the 'go'
      button. Watch what happens. Turn it off, and you'll see that all
      the turtles stop in their tracks.
    <p>
      Note that if a turtle moves off the edge of the world, it
      &quot;wraps&quot;, that is, it appears on the other side. (This is
      the default behavior. It can be changed; see the <a href="programming.html#Topology">Topology</a> section of the Programming
      Guide for more information.)
    <h2>
      Experimenting with commands
    </h2>
    <p>
      We suggest you start experimenting with other turtle commands.
    <p>
      Type commands into the Command Center (like <code>turtles&gt; set color
      red</code>), or add commands to <code>setup</code>, <code>go</code>, or
      <code>move-turtles</code>.
    <p>
      Note that when you enter commands in the Command Center, you must
      choose <code>turtles&gt;</code>, <code>patches&gt;</code>,
      <code>links&gt;</code>, or <code>observer&gt;</code> in the popup menu on the
      left, depending on which agents are going to run the commands.
      It's just like using <code>ask turtles</code> or <code>ask
      patches</code>, but saves typing. You can also use the tab key to
      switch agent types, which you might find more convenient than using
      the menu.
    <p>
      You might try typing <code>turtles&gt;</code> <code>pen-down</code> into the
      Command Center and then pressing the go button.
    <p>
      Also, inside the <code>move-turtles</code> procedure you can try changing
      <code>right random 360</code> to <code>right random 45</code>.
    <p>
      Play around. It's easy and the results are immediate and visible
      -- one of NetLogo's many strengths.
    <p>
      When you feel you've done enough experimenting for now,
      you're ready to continue improving the model you are building.
    <h2>
      Patches and variables
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now we've got 100 turtles aimlessly moving around, completely
      unaware of anything else around them. Let's make things a little
      more interesting by giving these turtles a nice background against
      which to move.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Go back to the <code>setup</code> procedure. We can rewrite it as
        follows:
          <pre>
to setup
  clear-all
  setup-patches
  setup-turtles
  reset-ticks
end
</pre>
        <li>The new definition of <code>setup</code> refers to two new
        procedures. To define <code>setup-patches</code>, add this:
          <pre>
to setup-patches
  ask patches [ set pcolor green ]
end
</pre>
        </ul>
      <p>
        The <code>setup-patches</code> procedure sets the color of every patch
        to green to start with. (A turtle's color variable is <a href="dictionary.html#color"><code>color</code></a>; a patch's is
        <a href="dictionary.html#pcolor"><code>pcolor</code></a>.)
      <p>
        The only part remaining in our new 'setup' that is still
        undefined is <code>setup-turtles</code>.
      <ul>
        <li>Add this procedure too:
          <pre>
to setup-turtles
  create-turtles 100
  ask turtles [ setxy random-xcor random-ycor ]
end
</pre>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Did you notice that the new <code>setup-turtles</code> procedure has
        most of the same commands as the old <code>setup</code> procedure?
      <ul>
        <li>Switch back to the Interface tab.
        <li>Press the setup button.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Voila! A lush NetLogo landscape complete with turtles and green
      patches appears:
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/scatter-on-green.gif">
    <p>
      After seeing the new <code>setup</code> procedure work a few times, you
      may find it helpful to read through the procedure definitions again.
    <h2>
      Turtle variables
    </h2>
    <p>
      So we have some turtles running around on a landscape, but they
      aren't doing anything with it. Let's add some interaction
      between the turtles and the patches.
    <p>
      We'll make the turtles eat &quot;grass&quot; (the green patches),
      reproduce, and die. The grass will gradually grow back after it is
      eaten.
    <p>
      We'll need a way of controlling when a turtle reproduces and
      dies. We'll determine that by keeping track of how much
      &quot;energy&quot; each turtle has. To do that we need to add a new
      turtle variable.
    <p>
      You've already seen built-in turtle variables like <a href="dictionary.html#color"><code>color</code></a>. To make a new turtle
      variable, we add a <a href="dictionary.html#turtles-own"><code>turtles-own</code></a> declaration at
      the top of the Code tab, before all the procedures. Call it
      <code>energy</code>:
    <pre>
turtles-own [energy]

to go
  move-turtles
  eat-grass
  tick
end
</pre>
    <p>
      Let's use this newly defined variable (<code>energy</code>) to allow
      the turtles to eat.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Switch to the Code tab.
        <li>Rewrite the <code>go</code> procedure as follows:
          <pre>
to go
  move-turtles
  eat-grass
  tick
end
</pre>
        <li>Add a new <code>eat-grass</code> procedure:
          <pre>
to eat-grass
  ask turtles [
    if pcolor = green [
      set pcolor black
      set energy energy + 10
    ]
  ]
end
</pre>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      We are using the <a href="dictionary.html#if"><code>if</code></a> command
      for the first time. Look at the code carefully. Each turtle, when it
      runs these commands, compares the value of the patch color it is on
      (<a href="dictionary.html#pcolor"><code>pcolor</code></a>) to the value
      for <code>green</code>. (A turtle has direct access to the variables of
      the patch it is standing on.) If the patch color is green, the
      comparison reports <code>true</code>, and only then will the turtle run
      the commands inside the brackets (otherwise it skips them). The
      commands make the turtle change the patch color to black and increase
      its own energy by 10. The patch turns black to signify that the grass
      at that spot has been eaten. And the turtle is given more energy,
      from having just eaten.
    <p>
      Next, let's make the movement of turtles use up some of the
      turtle's energy.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Rewrite <code>move-turtles</code> as follows:
          <pre>
to move-turtles
  ask turtles [
    right random 360
    forward 1
    set energy energy - 1
  ]
end
</pre>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      As each turtle wanders, it will lose one unit of energy at each step.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Switch to the Interface tab now and press the setup button and
        the go button.
        </ul>
      <p>
        You'll see the patches turn black as turtles travel over them.
      <p class="screenshot">
        <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/eating-grass.gif">
      </div>
    <h2>
      Monitors
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next you will create two monitors in the Interface tab with the
      toolbar. (You make them just like buttons and sliders, using the Add
      icon on the toolbar.) Let's make the first monitor now.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Create a monitor by clicking the Add icon on the toolbar,
        selecting Monitor next to it, and clicking on an open spot in the
        Interface.
        </ul>
      <p class="question">
        A dialog box will appear.
      <ul>
        <li>In the dialog type: <code>count turtles</code> (see image below).
        <li>Press the OK button to close the dialog.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/monitor-1.gif">
    <p>
      <a href="dictionary.html#turtles"><code>turtles</code></a> is an
      &quot;agentset&quot;, the set of all turtles. <a href="dictionary.html#count"><code>count</code></a> tells us how many agents
      are in that set.
    <p>
      Let's make the second monitor now:
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Create a monitor by clicking the Add icon on the toolbar,
        selecting Monitor next to it, and clicking on an open spot in the
        Interface.
        </ul>
      <p class="question">
        A dialog box will appear.
      <ul>
        <li>In the Reporter section of the dialog box type: <code>count
        patches with [pcolor = green]</code> (see image below).
        <li>In the Display name section of the dialog box type: <code>green
        patches</code>
        <li>Press the OK button to close the dialog box.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/monitor-2.gif">
    <p>
      Here we're using <a href="dictionary.html#count"><code>count</code></a> again to see how many
      agents are in an agentset. <a href="dictionary.html#patches"><code>patches</code></a> is the set of all the
      patches, but we don't just want to know how many patches there
      are total, we want to know how many of them are green. That's
      what <a href="dictionary.html#with"><code>with</code></a> does; it makes
      a smaller agentset of just those agents for whom the condition in the
      brackets is true. The condition is <code>pcolor = green</code>, so that
      gives us just the green patches.
    <p>
      Now we have two monitors that will report how many turtles and green
      patches we have, to help us track what's going on in our model.
      As the model runs, the numbers in the monitors will automatically
      change.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Use the setup and go buttons and watch the numbers in the
        monitors change.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>
      Switches and labels
    </h2>
    <p>
      The turtles aren't just turning the patches black. They're
      also gaining and losing energy. As the model runs, try using a turtle
      monitor to watch one turtle's energy go up and down.
    <p>
      It would be nicer if we could see every turtle's energy all the
      time. We will now do exactly that, and add a switch so we can turn
      the extra visual information on and off.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Click on the Add icon on the toolbar (in the Interface tab).
        <li>Select Switch from the menu next to Add.

        </ul>
      <p class="question">
        A dialog will appear.
      <ul>
        <li>Into the Global variable field, type <code>show-energy?</code>

        image below.)
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/switch.gif">
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Now go back to the 'go' procedure using the Code tab
        with the Toolbar.
        <li>Rewrite the <code>eat-grass</code> procedure as follows:
          <pre>
to eat-grass
  ask turtles [
    if pcolor = green [
      set pcolor black
      set energy energy + 10
    ]
  ifelse show-energy?
    [ set label energy ]
    [ set label &quot;&quot; ]
  ]
end
</pre>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      The <code>eat-grass</code> procedure introduces the <a href="dictionary.html#ifelse"><code>ifelse</code></a> command. Look at the
      code carefully. Each turtle, when it runs these new commands, checks
      the value of <code>show-energy?</code> (determined by the switch). If the
      switch is on, comparison is true and the turtle will run the commands
      inside the first set of brackets. In this case, it assigns the value
      for the energy to the label of the turtle. If the comparison is false
      (the switch is off) then the turtle runs the commands inside the
      second set of brackets. In this case, it removes the text labels (by
      setting the label of the turtle to be nothing).
    <p>
      (In NetLogo, a piece of text is called a &quot;string&quot;, short
      for string of characters. A string is a sequence of letters or other
      characters, written between double quotes. Here we have two double
      quotes right next to each other, with nothing in between them.
      That's an empty string. If a turtle's label is an empty
      string, no text is attached to the turtle.)
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Test this in the Interface tab, by running the model (using the
        setup and go buttons) switching the <code>show-energy?</code> switch
        back and forth.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      When the switch is on, you'll see the energy of each turtle go up
      each time it eats grass. You'll also see its energy going down
      whenever it moves.

    <h2>
      More procedures
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now our turtles are eating. Let's make them reproduce and die,
      too. And let's make the grass grow back. We'll add all three
      of these of these behaviors now, by making three separate procedures,
      one for each behavior.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Go to the Code tab.
        <li>Rewrite the <code>go</code> procedure as follows:
          <pre>
to go
  move-turtles
  eat-grass
  reproduce
  check-death
  regrow-grass
  tick
end
</pre>
        <li>Add the procedures for <code>reproduce</code>,
        <code>check-death</code>, and <code>regrow-grass</code> as shown below:
          <pre>
to reproduce
  ask turtles [
    if energy &gt; 50 [
      set energy energy - 50
      hatch 1 [ set energy 50 ]
    ]
  ]
end

to check-death
  ask turtles [
    if energy &lt;= 0 [ die ]
  ]
end

to regrow-grass
  ask patches [
    if random 100 &lt; 3 [ set pcolor green ]
  ]
end
</pre>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Each of these procedures uses the <a href="dictionary.html#if"><code>if</code></a> command. Each turtle, when it
      runs <code>check-death</code> it will check to see if its energy is less
      or equal to 0. If this is true, then the turtle is told to <a href="dictionary.html#die"><code>die</code></a> (die is a NetLogo primitive).
    <p>
      When each turtle runs <code>reproduce</code>, it checks the value of the
      turtle's <code>energy</code> variable. If it is greater than 50, then
      the turtle runs the commands inside the first set of brackets. In
      this case, it decreases the turtle's energy by 50, then
      'hatches' a new turtle with an energy of 50. The <a href="dictionary.html#hatch"><code>hatch</code></a> command is a NetLogo
      primitive which looks like this: <code>hatch</code> <i>number</i> [
      <i>commands</i> ]. This turtle creates <i>number</i> new turtles,
      each identical to its parent, and asks the new turtle(s) that have
      been hatched to run <i>commands</i>. You can use the commands to give
      the new turtles different colors, headings, or whatever. In our case
      we run one command. We set the energy for the newly hatched turtle to
      be 50.
    <p>
      When each patch runs <code>regrow-grass</code> it will check to see if a
      random integer from 0 to 99 is less than 3. If so, the patch color is
      set to green. This will happen 3% of the time (on average) for each
      patch, since there are three numbers (0, 1, and 2) out of 100
      possible that are less than 3.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Switch to the Interface tab now and press the setup and go
        buttons.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      You should see some interesting behavior in your model now. Some
      turtles die off, some new turtles are created (hatched), and some
      grass grows back. This is exactly what we set out to do.
    <p>
      If you continue to watch your monitors in your model, you will see
      that the <b>count turtles</b> and <b>green patches</b> monitors both
      fluctuate. Is this pattern of fluctuation predictable? Is there a
      relationship between the variables?
    <p>
      It'd be nice if we had a easier way to track the changes in the
      model behavior over time. NetLogo allows us to plot data as we go
      along. That will be our next step.
    <h2>
      Plotting
    </h2>
    <p>
      To make plotting work, we'll need to create a plot in the
      Interface tab and put some commands inside it.
    <p>
      The commands we put in the plots will run automatically when our
      <code>setup</code> procedure calls <code>reset-ticks</code> and when our
      <code>go</code> procedure calls <code>tick</code>.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Create a plot by clicking the Add icon on the toolbar,
        selecting Plot next to it, and clicking on an open spot in the
        Interface.
        <li>Set its Name to &quot;Totals&quot; (see image below)
        <li>Set the X axis label to &quot;time&quot;
        <li>Set the Y axis label to &quot;totals&quot;
        <li>Change the name of the &quot;default&quot; pen to
        &quot;turtles&quot;.
        <li>Enter <code>plot count turtles</code> under Pen Update Commands.
        <li>Press the &quot;Add Pen&quot; button.
        <li>Change the name of the new pen to &quot;grass&quot;.
        <li>Enter <code>plot count patches with [pcolor = green]</code> under
        Pen Update Commands.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      When you're done, the dialog should look like this:
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/totals.gif">
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Press OK in the Plot dialog to finish editing.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Note that when you create the plot you can also set the minimum and
      maximum values on the X and Y axes. You'll want to leave the
      &quot;Auto Scale&quot; checkbox checked, so that if anything you plot
      exceeds the minimum and maximum values for the axes, the axes will
      automatically grow so you can see all the data.
    <p>
      Note that we used the <a href="dictionary.html#plot"><code>plot</code></a> command to add the next
      point to a plot. This command moves the current plot pen to the point
      that has an X coordinate equal to 1 greater than the previously
      plotted X coordinate and a Y coordinate equal to the value given in
      the plot command (in the first case, the number of turtles, and in
      the second case, the number of green patches). As the pens move they
      each draw a line.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Setup and run the model again.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      You can now watch the plot being drawn as the model is running. Your
      plot should have the general shape of the one below, though your plot
      might not look exactly the same.
    <p>
      Remember that we left &quot;Auto Scale?&quot; on. This allows the
      plot to readjust itself when it runs out of room.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/tutorial3/plotwindow.png">
    <p>
      If you forget which pen is which, you can edit the plot and check the
      &quot;Show legend?&quot; checkbox.
    <p>
      You might try running the model several times to see what aspects of
      the plot are the same and which are different from run to run.
    <h2>
      Tick counter
    </h2>
    <p>
      To make comparisons between plots from one model run and another, it
      is often useful to do the comparison for the same length of model
      run. Learning how to stop or start an action at a specific time can
      help make this happen by stopping the model at the same point each
      model run. Keeping track of how many times the <code>go</code> procedure
      is run is a useful way to cue these actions. That's what the tick
      counter does.
    <p>
      You're already using the tick counter in your model, with the
      <code>reset-ticks</code> and <code>tick</code> commands, which also trigger
      plotting.
    <p>
      You can also use the tick counter for other things, such as to set a
      limit on the total length of a run.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Change the <code>go</code> procedure:
          <pre>
to go
  if ticks &gt;= 500 [ stop ]
  move-turtles
  eat-grass
  check-death
  reproduce
  regrow-grass
  tick
end
</pre>
        <li>Now setup and run the model.
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      The graph and model won't keep running forever. They should stop
      automatically when the tick counter in the Interface tab's
      toolbar reaches 500.
    <p>
      The <a href="dictionary.html#tick"><code>tick</code></a> command advances
      the tick counter by 1. <a href="dictionary.html#ticks"><code>ticks</code></a> is a reporter which
      reports the current value of the tick counter. <a href="dictionary.html#reset-ticks"><code>reset-ticks</code></a>, in your
      <code>setup</code> procedure, takes care of restarting the tick counter
      at 0 when a new run is set up and ready to begin.
    <h2>
      Some more details
    </h2>
    <p>
      First, instead of always using 100 turtles, you can have a varying
      number of turtles.
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Create a slider named &quot;number&quot;: click the Add icon on
        the toolbar, select Slider next to it, and click on an open spot in
        the interface.
        <li>Try changing the minimum and maximum values in the slider.
        <li>Then inside of <code>setup-turtles</code>, instead of
        <code>create-turtles 100</code> you can type:
          <pre>
to setup-turtles
  create-turtles number [ setxy random-xcor random-ycor ]
end
</pre>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Test this change and compare how having more or fewer turtles
      initially affect the plots over time.
    <p>
      Second, wouldn't it be nice to adjust the energy the turtles gain
      and lose as they eat grass and reproduce?
    <div class="blockquote">
      <ul>
        <li>Make a slider called <code>energy-from-grass</code>.
        <li>Make another slider called <code>birth-energy</code>.
        <li>Then, inside of <code>eat-grass,</code> make this change:
          <pre>
to eat-grass
  ask turtles [
    if pcolor = green [
      set pcolor black
      set energy (energy + energy-from-grass)
    ]
    ifelse show-energy?
      [ set label energy ]
      [ set label &quot;&quot; ]
  ]
end
</pre>
        <li>And, inside of <code>reproduce</code>, make this change:
          <pre>
to reproduce
  ask turtles [
    if energy &gt; birth-energy [
      set energy energy - birth-energy
      hatch 1 [ set energy birth-energy ]
    ]
  ]
end
</pre>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Finally, what other slider could you add to vary how often grass
      grows back? Are there rules you can add to the movement of the
      turtles or to the newly hatched turtles that happen only at certain
      times? Try writing them.
    <h2>
      What's next?
    </h2>
    <p>
      So now you have a simple model of an ecosystem. Patches grow grass.
      Turtles wander, eat the grass, reproduce, and die.
    <p>
      You have created an interface containing buttons, sliders, switches,
      monitors, and a plot. You've even written a series of procedures
      to give the turtles something to do.
    <p>
      That's where this tutorial leaves off.
    <p>
      If you'd like to look at some more documentation about NetLogo,
      the <a href="interface.html">Interface Guide</a> section of the
      manual walks you through every element of the NetLogo interface in
      order and explains its function. For a detailed description and
      specifics about writing procedures, refer to the <a href="programming.html">Programming Guide</a>. All of the primitives are
      listed and described in the <a href="dictionary.html">NetLogo
      Dictionary</a>.
    <p>
      Also, you can continue experimenting with and expanding this model if
      you'd like, experimenting with different variables and behaviors
      for the agents.
    <p>
      Alternatively, you may want to revisit the first model in the
      tutorial, Wolf Sheep Predation. This is the model you used in
      <code>Tutorial #1</code>. In the Wolf Sheep Predation model, you saw
      sheep move around, consume resources that are replenished
      occasionally (grass), reproduce under certain conditions, and die if
      they ran out of resources. But that model had another type of
      creature moving around -- wolves. The addition of wolves requires
      some additional procedures and some new primitives. Wolves and sheep
      are two different &quot;breeds&quot; of turtle. To see how to use
      breeds, study Wolf Sheep Predation.
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can look at other models (including the many
      models in the Code Examples section of the Models Library) or even go
      ahead and build your own model. You don't even have to model
      anything. It can be interesting just to watch patches and turtles
      forming patterns, to try to create a game to play, or whatever.
    <p>
      Hopefully you have learned some things, both in terms of the NetLogo
      language and about how to go about building a model. The entire set
      of procedures that was created above is shown below.
    <h2>
      <a>Appendix: Complete code</a>
    </h2>
    <p id="sample">
      The complete model is also available in NetLogo's Models Library,
      in the Code Examples section. It's called &quot;Tutorial 3&quot;.
    <p>
      Notice that this listing is full of &quot;comments&quot;, which begin
      with semicolons. Comments let you mix an explanation the code right
      in with the code itself. You might use comments to help others
      understand your model, or you might use them as notes to yourself.
    <p>
      In the Code tab, comments are gray, so your eyes can pick them out
      easily.
