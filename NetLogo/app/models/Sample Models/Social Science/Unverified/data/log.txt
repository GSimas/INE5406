Added Jun 20, 2011

July 12, 2011: Forrest made changes:
 * Expanded infotab.
 * Changed interface slider names to conform to NetLogo naming.
 * Changed to use ticks, instead of custom "years" variable...  (needs finished)

Jan 22, 2012: Forrest looked at this again.  
  * Finished changing it to use TICKS instead of a custom years variable
  * Shortened the file-loading code some.
  * It's not a "quick fix" situation, at least if we want to go over the code and make it in good style and NetLogo-y.

Feb 4, 2012: Forrest worked on it quite a bit.
  * fixed all the variable naming and procedure naming inconsistencies (I think)
  * renamed a lot of variables to have more informative names, or from using 0 or 1 to boolean true/false...
  * removed several unused variables
  * updated to version 5.0 plotting.
  * removed the histograms which I felt weren't very informative...
  * worked on infotab some, but it still could use an overhaul.  :-/
